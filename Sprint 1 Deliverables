Requirement 2: For the moment we've decided on a dockerized web application approach for our framework (Frontend <-> Backend <-> Database).

Requirement 1: We've decided on this headset. https://www.emotiv.com/product/emotiv-epoc-x-14-channel-mobile-brainwear/

The Emotive headset ended up winning because we found out,
that we didn't care about having as many electrodes as possible 
like we though we might. The three biggests pros for the emotiv
headset are that it has the temporal resolution of (1 ms), 
can be set up an ran within 10 minutes, and has propritary 
software to record EEG data for us.

Requirement 12: The Github has been created. You're looking at it.

Requirement 9: The proper push reviews have been set up.

Requirement 6: We did research into the visualization methods. Our current leading contenders are Matplotlib: a library for Python,
or Matlab: third-party data visualization software. We'll be creating demos for those two and others to see which we prefer next sprint.

Requirement 12: We did background research into the EEG data. Here are the resources we found:
