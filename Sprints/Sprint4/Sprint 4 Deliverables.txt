Requirement 7: Figure Out EEG Data Gathering
    It seems that because of Emotiv's proprietary software that
    you have to use to get the headset running, we can't have any
    streamlined processes that will take the live EEG data into
    the generative art work program. We'll have to run sessions of 
    the headset and then upload the eeg data files into the program
    after we download it from the Emotiv software. This isn't necessarily
    a problem though! We can scale up our web services so that anyone
    can upload their eeg data and get generative art from it.
