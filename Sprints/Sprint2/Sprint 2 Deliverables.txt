Requirement 3: We have placed the order for the headset 
    and the screenshot of the order has been placed in 
    this folder.

Requirement 5: We have all dones our own demos and have played around
    in different artistic libraries. We decided that any form of 
    Processing (Processing, P5.js, Processing.py) is the best solution.

Requirement 8: The initial dataset we found on Kaggle has
    been put in the base /Data folder.

Requirement 20: EEGBaseVisualization.py is the script that 
    was used to demo the EEG data that we got from Kaggle.
    The EEGBaseVisualization_1.png and EEGBaseVisualization_2.png
    files are some of the outputs from it.
