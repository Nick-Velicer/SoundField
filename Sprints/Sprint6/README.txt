preproc.IPYNB is our current implementation of the preprocessing.
The best way to accomplish this is through ICA, but the documentation
of how to use it is extremely dense so we plan to get it working over
the holidays. Many lines are commented out before we use them. This
isn't a mistake and we're leaving them in for the moment.
