GAMEEMO Paper 
“Database for an emotion recognition system based on EEG signals and various computer games – GAMEEMO”
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809420301075?via%3Dihub
“An Analysis of Game-Related Emotions Using EMOTIV EPOC” 
https://annals-csis.org/Volume_15/drp/pdf/296.pdf
Not the same data, but similar paper

“Detecting Emotion from EEG Signals Using the Emotive Epoc Device”
http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/250aff/ramirez.pdf
	
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying emotional state for each segment
Results obtained with OpenVibe software
Standard 10-fold cross evaluation

“A review of classification algorithms for EEG-based brain–computer interfaces: a 10 year update”
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aab2f2/meta
Feature extraction and selection have many benefits
LDA and SVM methods are most popular for BCI classification, but need initial calibration and training data
Adaptive classifiers prove still effective but can use limited initial calibration/training data

OpenVibe Tutorials:
*Note that they have many good tutorials on open vibe, need Windows or Linux to download, I will look more into that
Classifier trainer tutorial:
http://openvibe.inria.fr/documentation/1.0.1/Doc_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer.html
Tutorial on using python with OpenVibe:
http://openvibe.inria.fr/tutorial-using-python-with-openvibe/

Powerpoint presentation on using OpenVibe and BCI:
Has a lot of valuable information, need to actually follow along doing tutorial
https://hal.science/hal-03374960/file/HandsOn_OV_CuttingEEG_2021.pdf
Also, GitHub tutorial that goes along with it (I think)
https://github.com/BCI-NET/BCI-OpenViBE-CuttingEEG2021/

Linear Discriminant Analysis:
What is it and how to use in python tutorial

“EPOC Emotiv EEG Basics”:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361458671_EPOC_Emotiv_EEG_Basics
Not peer reviewed, mainly advice
They used EMOKIT to get raw data
SVM and LDA classifiers

Keynote on EEG and ML:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63k0Zc3yWb4
She uses Azure ML for her machine learning
Beginning is good intro
Only got through 34 min, not sure how valuable it is
SEED dataset:
https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/
Emotional dataset!! Could be valuable, need to look more into
