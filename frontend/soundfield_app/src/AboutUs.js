        <h4><br></br>Hello, we're Soundfield, a small team of 5 students working
        on our capstone project at Kansas University. We've designed an application
        that aims to visualize your brain activity while listening to music. The
        program is a marriage of Code, Art, and Neuroscience where we use generative
        art to make unique creations based on your thoughts while listening to
        different kinds of music. We take input from a CSV document generated from
        14-channel EEG headset and create artwork based on the thought and emotional
        patterns that are recorded there.</h4>
